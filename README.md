# YOURLS, Kubernetes, and Networks
This repository walks you through a step-by-step guide into experimenting with container orchestration and microservice architecture.
For the purposes of this application, we will be using Docker Desktop, K3d, and Docker Hub. 
Docker Desktop is required to provide the underlying containerruntime for k3d and the Docker Network. K3d is a local version of Kubernetes used to simulate a producstion-level environment.

### Please follow the following tutorials for downloading and installing K3d and Docker Desktop:
ðŸ‘‰ [Download Docker Desktop here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
ðŸ‘‰ [View k3d Installation Requirements and Instructions](https://k3d.io/stable/#requirements)

## Steps for Set Up
1. Start with the Docker Networks Guide
   * This will walk you through creating a YOURLS username and password and setting up the network configurations. Remember to tailor the scripts in this repository to your specific credentials
2. Follow the Kubernetes guide

## Watch out for
This project requires intensive CPU and memory usage. Without sufficient hardware, running this experiment can cause hardware failures, computer crashes, and memory loss.
